			<hr>
			<p>You all may remember that while celebrating the Golden Jubilee of our alma mater in 2005, we decided to create something to commemorate the glorious history of this great institute, we all are indebted to. Later on it was decided to create a facility that can be used by the students and faculty members as well as alumni of this great institute.</p>
			<p>On Behalf of Alumni Association of GEC NIT Raipur, It is a pleasure to present to you <b>"THE GOLDEN TOWER"</b> an environment friendly <b>Green Building</b> with unique facility serving the cause of engineering education and engineers in the region. We wish that the Golden Tower itself will be providing such quality services to the NIT Raipur and alumni which is hitherto unavailable.</p>
			<p>Its first and foremost purpose will be to connect the whole alumni community with the institute for enhancing the brand value of NIT Raipur. It will be a center for pooling up various energies - materialistic, spiritual and philosophical - of all the alumni and then effective and efficient usages of these energies for the fulfillment of Alumni Associationâ€™s aims and goals.</p>
			<p>We are very happy to share that for the construction of Golden Tower our alma mater has allocated 30,128 sqft land and we have finalized the project over 40,000 sqft built up area. Construction of the first phase of 11,000 sqft built up area costing approximately Rs 1.5 crore has started in the gracious presence of our alumnus Mr. Gouri Shankar Agrawal (1973/Electrical), Speaker, Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly. We are happy to share that Mr. Agrawal has donated Rs. 2 lakh for the construction of the first phase of Golden Tower. Several alumni have started contributing.</p>
			<p>The building would be correctly named as <b>The Golden Tower</b>; the style of the building would be ultra modern Green Building rated under GRIHA and would house several features as follows:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Administrative offices</li>
				<li>Exhibition Area</li>
				<li>Conference Area</li>
				<li>Lecture Halls</li>
				<li>Digital Library</li>
				<li>Guest rooms</li>
				<li>Recreational spaces</li>
				<li>Cafeteria</li>
				<li>Residential Suites</li>
				<li>Canteen</li>
				<li>Restaurant</li>
				<li>Other Utilities</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>The site is at the intersection of GE Road and the road to Sanskrit College, located at the right side of the entrance.</p>
